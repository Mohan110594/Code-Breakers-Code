If a topological sort exists for a graph, then the reverse postorder is also a topological sort. In particular, we can find a topological sort for an acyclic digraph, with depth first search.

Topological sort is used to find cycles in Directed graph.


A directed graph has a topological sort if and only if it does not have any cycles.


what is Topological sort ??

Topological Sort - This is an ordering of all vertices in a digraph, such that if we lined up all vertices from left to right, then all the edges could be drawn as pointing to the right. A digraph may have one, multiple, or zero topological sorts.
